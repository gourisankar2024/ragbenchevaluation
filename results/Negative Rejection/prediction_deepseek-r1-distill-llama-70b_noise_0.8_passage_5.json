That seems pretty clear. It also notes that it was available on demand starting from January 3 through January 16. So that's the premiere date.\n\nI should check the other parts of the document to see if there's any conflicting information. Another section talks about the concert tour in 2010 and the film being released 12 years later, which would be 2022. That aligns with the January 2022 date.\n\nThere's also a part about the original performances in 1970 and a 2007 reunion, but that's about their concerts, not the film's premiere.

The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie.

The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

Let me start by going through the provided documents carefully to find any mentions of Valdosta State and Georgia Tech in relation to Semore.\n\nLooking at the first document, it mentions that in 2021, Semore was the Defensive Coordinator at Valdosta State. It also notes that before that, he was at Georgia Tech from 2019 to 2020 as a Defensive Analyst. So, the timeline seems to be that he was at Georgia Tech first, then moved to Valdosta State in 2021. Therefore, before returning to Georgia Tech, he was at Valdosta State as the Defensive Coordinator.\n\nWait, but the question is asking what position he held at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech. From the document, it looks like after Valdosta State, he might have moved elsewhere, but the document doesn't explicitly say he returned to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State. It just lists his positions up to 2021. So, perhaps the question assumes he went back to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State, but the document doesn't specify that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking about his position at Valdosta State before he went to Georgia Tech, but the document shows he was at Georgia Tech before Valdosta State. Let me check the dates again. From 2019-2020, he was at Georgia Tech as a Defensive Analyst, and in 2021, he was at Valdosta State as Defensive Coordinator. So, he was at Valdosta State after Georgia Tech, not before. \n\nWait, that seems conflicting. So, he was at Georgia Tech in 2019-2020, then in 2021, he moved to Valdosta State. So, he didn't return to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State; he went to Valdosta State after Georgia Tech. Therefore, the question might have a mistake in the timeline. \n\nBut the question is asking what position he held at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech. Since the documents don't mention him returning to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State, perhaps the correct answer is that he was the Defensive Coordinator at Valdosta State in 2021, and there's no mention of him returning to Georgia Tech after that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confused about the timeline, thinking he went from Valdosta State back to Georgia Tech, but the documents don't show that.

And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either.

Let me start by recalling what I know about the Super Bowl locations. I remember that the Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the NFL, and it's usually held in early February. Each year, it's hosted in a different city, often in a stadium that's either new or has been renovated.\n\nLooking at the documents provided, I should scan through them to find any mention of the 2022 Super Bowl. Let me go through each paragraph one by one.\n\nThe first paragraph talks about Super Bowl XLIV and XLIX, which were in 2010 and 2015 respectively. That's too early. Then it mentions the location selection process and some history about potential locations like London, but nothing about 2022 yet.\n\nThe second paragraph discusses Super Bowl LV, which was in 2021, and then mentions that LVII is set for 2023 in Glendale, Arizona. It also notes the locations for 2024 and 2025. So, Super Bowl LVII is 2023, which means Super Bowl LVI would be 2022.\n\nNow, looking further down, there's a specific section about Super Bowl LVI. It says that it was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. That's the home stadium of the Los Angeles Rams, and they actually won the game that year against the Cincinnati Bengals. This makes sense because I remember hearing that the Rams won the Super Bowl in their home stadium, which was a relatively new occurrence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the 2022 Super Bowl, which is Super Bowl LVI, was held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.

Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]", "At Super Bowl LV, it was Tom Brady stealing the show yet again, but for the first time in his career, not while wearing a New England Patriots jersey.  Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla.

The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.", "Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.  To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.", "Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).  Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H.

Former US President Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, is now available to download from Apple's App Store. It was launched on February 21st, 2022, which is President’s Day in the US. Immediately upon launching, the app reached the number one spot on the App Store's Top Charts.

According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant. Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform, which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce.  Truth Social announced a public beta of the web app just last week.

Let me start by looking through the provided documents. \n\nThe first document mentions the 79th annual Golden Globe Awards were held on January 9, 2022. It talks about the nominees for Best Picture, Drama, but doesn't specify the winner. The second document is about the 80th Golden Globes, which aired in 2023, so that's not relevant here.\n\nLooking at the third document, it's labeled as the 79th Golden Globes.

Visitors recently watched a light show at the newly built ski jumping center in northern China's Hebei province. We're still in the final days of the Tokyo Summer Olympics — but thanks to the one-year delay of these Games, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are now less than six months away. \"All venues and facilities for Beijing 2022 are close to complete,\" organizers said in a recent update.  Those structures range from luge tracks and skating rinks to snowboard courses. The 12 ice and snow venues are scattered between Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, which includes a large mountain resort. Test events were held at those venues this year to fine-tune them for  competition, organizers said. While many facilities are brand-new, some may look familiar: The famous \"Water Cube\" that hosted Olympic swimming in 2008, for instance, is now the \"Ice Cube,\" to host curling.", "The host nation China finished third with nine gold medals and also eleventh place by total medals won, marking its most successful performance in Winter Olympics history.[4]  The bidding calendar was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2012, with the application deadline set for 14 November 2013.[5] The IOC Executive Board reviewed the bids from all applicant cities on 7 July 2014 and selected three cities, Oslo (Norway), Almaty (Kazakhstan), and Beijing (China), as the final candidates.[6]  Several bid cities withdrew their bids during the process, citing the high costs or the lack of local support and funding for hosting the Games.[7] The Oslo bid, considered the clear frontrunner, was canceled in the wake of a series of revelations about the IOC's demands for luxury treatment of IOC members that strongly turned public opinion and the parliamentary majority against the bid. The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family.", "The 2022 Winter Olympics (2022年冬季奥林匹克运动会), officially called the XXIV Olympic Winter Games (Chinese: 第二十四届冬季奥林匹克运动会; pinyin: Dì Èrshísì Jiè Dōngjì Àolínpǐkè Yùndònghuì) and commonly known as Beijing 2022 (北京2022), was an international winter multi-sport event held from 4 to 20 February 2022 in Beijing, China, and surrounding areas with competition in selected events beginning 2 February 2022.[1] It was the 24th edition of the Winter Olympic Games.

Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics.", "Mirroring a protocol adopted for the 2020 Summer Olympics before they were moved behind closed doors, the IOC also announced that only residents of the People's Republic of China would be permitted to attend the Games as spectators.[38][39]  On 23 December 2021, the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) announced that they had agreed to withdraw their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak[40] As part of their latest collective agreement with the NHLPA, the NHL had agreed to accommodate a break for the Olympics and player participation for the first time since 2014.[41]  On 17 January 2022, amid increasing lockdowns across China and the first detected case of the Omicron variant in Beijing, it was announced that ticket sales to the general public were cancelled, and that limited numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only.

However, the limitation of OLEDs in AR applications is that most AR headset devices are used in sunlit environments. As a result, the low brightness environment required by OLEDs can be an issue.   Guillaume Chansin, head of display research at DSCC, a display research organization, said, \"MicroLEDs can be used in brighter environments than OLEDs, which is especially important for AR smart glasses that need to be used outdoors.", "12]  In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used \"outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world\", internally codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload. The demand for data centres, AI, and ML (machine learning) among enterprises such as Government and educational entities, is witnessing exponential growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic boosting the demand for supercomputers, Mordor Intelligence said in a report.", "At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.) These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change? The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.", "Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads.

The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought.

First things first: you want to know how hard this game is, right? “How hard is Elden Ring?” we hear you ask. The game may have been designed for “all sorts of players” and not just “hardened veterans” (as per FromSoftware marketing and communications manager Yasuhiro Kitao) but don’t let that dissuade you if you are a hardcore fan: game director and master of all things sadistic Hidetaka Miyazaki says that Elden Ring is about as hard as Dark Souls 3. As per the director, the game has been made so that players will find it “very difficult, but it can be handled.” Don’t expect difficulty settings, then, or any hand-holding throughout the entire experience. Veteran Soulsbourne players, eat your hearts out.  Miyazaki explains that he feels “the difficulty level as a pure action game is lower.” Instead, Miyazaki states “I think that the closest image of difficulty is Dark Souls III.", "Popular Games Latest game news Subscribe to our newsletter and keep up to date with our products and services.

However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the  iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini.

This is the first time that Apple’s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though — like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn’t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn’t quite over yet.

In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]", "The orbiter will image the landing site and determine the conditions on the ground in preparation for the landing.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school.

This film directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, from a story by Seth Gordon, features Loretta Sage, a brilliant author who writes romance novels set in exotic locations featuring Dr. Angela Lovemore and her romantic interest, Dash McMahon. But Loretta's real life bears no resemblance to the things she writes: after her husband's death, she became a reclusive, grumpy woman who is not even eager to write anymore. Halfway through a promotional tour for her latest novel, Loretta is kidnapped by a lunatic billionaire who wants her to lead him to a lost city treasure she depicted in her book.

{"id": 40, "query": "What happened at the Academy Awards involving Will Smith and Chris Rock?", "ans": ["slapped"], "label": [1], "prediction": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out what happened at the Academy Awards involving Will Smith and Chris Rock. I remember hearing about this incident, but I'm not entirely sure of all the details. Let me try to piece it together using the information from the provided document.\n\nFirst, the event took place during the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022. From what I recall, Chris Rock was presenting an award when he made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith's wife. Jada has alopecia areata, which causes hair loss, and she had been shaving her head because of it. Rock made a G.I. Jane joke, referencing her shaved head. \n\nAccording to the document, Will Smith walked on stage and slapped Chris Rock across the face. After that, Smith returned to his seat and shouted some profanities at Rock. Rock, though taken aback, continued with the presentation. Later that evening, Smith won the Best Actor award for his role in King Richard. In his acceptance speech, he apologized to the Academy and the nominees but didn't mention Rock specifically. The next day, he did apologize to Rock via social media.\n\nThe document also mentions that there was some confusion about whether Smith was asked to leave the ceremony. The Academy initially said he was asked to leave but refused, but some people present denied that. There was a disagreement between the Academy leadership and the ceremony producer, Will Packer, about whether Smith should stay. Packer thought Rock wouldn't want Smith removed, so no action was taken.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the incident became a huge topic on social media, with memes and parodies spreading. There were also reactions from other celebrities, with some condemning Smith's actions and others supporting him. Questlove, who won an award right after the incident, didn't notice it at first because he was meditating and only realized what happened just before his speech.\n\nThe consequences for Smith were significant. He resigned from the Academy and was banned from attending their events for 10 years. The incident overshadowed the rest of the ceremony, with many people focusing on the slap rather than the awards themselves.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main points are: Chris Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's hair, Will Smith slapped him on stage, Smith later apologized, there was confusion about whether he was asked to leave, and the incident had major repercussions for Smith, including his resignation and ban from the Academy.\n</think>\n\nAt the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, a notable incident occurred involving Will Smith and Chris Rock. During the ceremony, Chris Rock, while presenting an award, made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, referencing her alopecia areata. In response, Will Smith walked on stage and slapped Rock. Smith then returned to his seat and shouted profanities, though Rock continued with the presentation.\n\nLater that evening, Smith won the Best Actor award for his role in \"King Richard.\" In his acceptance speech, he apologized to the Academy and nominees but did not mention Rock. The next day, Smith issued a public apology to Rock via social media.\n\nThere was confusion about whether Smith was asked to leave the ceremony, with the Academy initially stating he refused to leave, but others present denied this. Ceremony producer Will Packer opposed removing Smith, believing Rock wouldn't want that.\n\nThe incident became a viral sensation, overshadowing the ceremony, with significant social media attention. Questlove, who won an award immediately after the incident, was meditating and didn't realize what happened until just before his speech.\n\nConsequences for Smith included his resignation from the Academy and a 10-year ban from attending their events. The incident had a lasting impact, with many focusing on the slap rather than the awards themselves.", "docs": ["[14][17][18][19] Many Internet memes and parodies have been created from the photo and video.[29][30]  On March 31, additional smartphone footage was published from an audience member's perspective of the Smiths' table. This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.", "“In this time in my life, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.” Smith wept throughout his speech, which ranged from a defense of his actions to apologies to the Academy to an exaltation of Richard Williams. “I want to apologize to the Academy,” he said. “I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” At a comedy show that Wednesday, Rock seemed to imply that Smith has not reached out to him personally. Also that Wednesday, the Academy issued a statement saying that Smith was asked to leave the Oscars ceremony Sunday night and declined to do so. “Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated,” the statement said. “While we would like to clarify that Mr.", "Musician Questlove and film producers David Dinerstein, Robert Fyvolent, and Joseph Patel were on stage immediately after the incident to accept the Best Documentary Feature award for Summer of Soul, and some commenters opined that this award had been overshadowed by the incident.[77][78][79] The distracted audience searched Twitter for information on Rock and Smith.[14] Gabrielle Ulubay of Marie Claire wrote that Summer of Soul \"deserved to have its moment, and Questlove's touching speech and tribute to his parents deserved to have our full attention—but instead, the world kept its mind on Will Smith and Chris Rock and its eyes on Twitter\".[80]  Questlove was asked about the incident by a reporter in a backstage press conference immediately after leaving the stage, and declined: \"I'm not talking about that tonight, this is about the Harlem Cultural Festival.\"[81] In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the next night, Questlove said he did not notice the slap in the moment because he was using Transcendental Meditation to curb his anxiety before the winner was called, and did not realize what had happened until \"maybe three seconds before I spoke words\".[82][83]  Reactions from celebrity attendees at the Academy Awards varied. In general, there was strong condemnation of Smith's violence and support for Rock, though some defended Smith's actions or refused to side solely with either man.", "Rock: Wow, dude!  Smith: Yes.  Rock: It was a G.I. Jane joke.  Smith: [voice rising] Keep my wife's name... out your fucking mouth!  Rock: I'm going to, okay? Oh, I could, oh, okay. That was a... greatest night in the history of television, okay. [audience laughs] Okay—[15] This exchange caused the local audience and journalists to realize that Smith's reaction was genuine.[14][16] Kevin Costner, who waited offstage to present the Academy Award for Best Director, said, \"Oh, that was real.\"[13] Until Smith's acceptance speech, the reportedly stunned and confused audience expected any official acknowledgement from the stage, and those in the mezzanine level occasionally stood to peer over the balcony to seek action below. However, the show did not use hosts from this point and continued as normal.[14] Smith's expletives were censored by audio muting during the live broadcast in many countries.[14][17][18][19]  Photo-journalist Brian Snyder, working for Reuters in the photographer pool in the projection booth, photographed Smith striking Rock.[20] This photo quickly went viral, was featured in news stories, and was adapted into Internet memes.[16] He was unaware of the photo's cultural impact until after the ceremony, as his photos were automatically sent to his editors.", "During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges Méliès. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas.

In the first document, there's a mention of Tesla's production ramping up in Texas and Berlin, and it also talks about the China production recovery. It mentions specific numbers about Model Y production in Texas and the German plant, but that's more about production, not deliveries. It also discusses stock prices and market share, but that's not directly related to Q1 2022 deliveries.\n\nMoving on, I see a section that lists some statistics, including Tesla's vehicle production by quarter YTD Q1 2023 and revenue from 2008-2022. However, I'm looking for Q1 2022, so this might not be directly helpful unless it includes historical data. The document does mention that \"Vehicles & Road Traffic Automotive manufacturers' estimated market share in the U.S. 2022\" and \"Tesla's vehicle production by quarter YTD Q1 2023.\" It also references \"Tesla's revenue 2008-2022.\" While this includes 2022 data, it's about revenue, not deliveries.\n\nNext, there's a part about executives speaking at an all-hands meeting in Nevada, celebrating production records. It mentions that in August, the Fremont factory had a record production month, and the Austin factory hit 1,000 cars per week. This is about production, specifically in August, which would be part of Q3 2022, so not directly relevant to Q1.\n\nThen, I see a section stating that cumulatively, over 2.6 million Tesla cars were delivered. This is a cumulative figure, not specific to Q1 2022. It also mentions that Tesla produces Model Y in Germany and Texas, which might indicate increased production capacity, but again, not delivery numbers for Q1 2022.\n\nFurther down, there's a specific section titled \"Tesla just reported first-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2022.\" This seems promising. It states that electric vehicle deliveries totaled 310,048, with production at 305,407. It also breaks down that Model 3 and Model Y made up 95% of deliveries, which were 295,324 vehicles. The company produced 4,641 fewer cars than delivered, citing supply chain issues and factory shutdowns. Additionally, it mentions that analysts expected 317,000 deliveries, but Tesla delivered slightly less.\n\nSo, putting this together, the key information is in the last part of the document.

The production was a bit lower, but the delivery number is clearly stated as 310,048.\n</think>\n\nTesla delivered 310,048 vehicles in the first quarter of 2022.

The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.", "Oct 27, 2022 ...

But it’s not obvious that it wouldn’t be. And he’s a really smart guy. One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that. It’s not obvious how the company would, but if you’re sitting on top of a thing that can create that much value, surely, if you’re really smart then you can extract some value out of it."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}
