Let me look through the provided document for any dates related to the release or premiere.\n\nFirst, I see that the film is a documentary about their 50-year friendship and their 2010 Troubadour Reunion Tour. The document mentions that the movie hasn't been released yet, as it says, \"the movie has not released yet\" in one part. \n\nLooking for specific dates, I notice some mentions of August 7, 2023, at various times, but these seem to be related to showtimes or perhaps when the information was updated, not the premiere date. Another date I see is October 30, which is when Carole King is being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but that's not the movie's premiere.\n\nThe document also mentions that the film was supposed to be released in 2011 but wasn't, and it's now being released 12 years after the tour, which was in 2010. That would place the release around 2022, but I don't see a specific date. \n\nThere's a section that says the original release date (streaming) is not specified, and the only dates listed are showtimes on August 7, 2023, which might be when it started streaming or when it was available on certain platforms.\n\nSince the document doesn't provide a clear premiere date, I can't determine the exact date. It only mentions that the movie hasn't been released yet as of the document's last update.\n</think>\n\nI cannot provide the exact premiere date of 'Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name' as the document does not specify it.

The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS.", "Your Ticket Confirmation # is located under the header in your email that reads \"Your Ticket Reservation Details\".

The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we’ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.   Alright, so technically, this isn’t a summer road-trip movie, considering it’s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it’s still the all-time best buddy adventure film.

On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching.

He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.", "Even with a dad who coached, Semore knows his background – childhood on a reservation, Division II football – didn’t lend itself to the ready-made connections of other aspiring college coaches. But he says his experiences in Ganado, growing up among the Navajo, taught him how to feel at home in other cultures. And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either.

Let me start by looking through the provided documents to see if the answer is there.\n\nFirst, I see a document that mentions Tesla's Supercharger stations and their growth over the years. It talks about the number of stations in different countries and how they've expanded from 2018 to 2021. But that's about charging stations, not vehicle deliveries.\n\nThen, there's a part that lists some quarterly figures up to Q4 2022, but I'm not sure if that includes the actual delivery numbers for each year, especially 2021. It mentions that prior figures were from Tesla updates, but without specific numbers, I can't tell.\n\nNext, I notice a section that discusses Tesla's revenue from 2008 to 2022, but again, revenue isn't the same as deliveries. Revenue could be influenced by many factors, including pricing and model mix, so that's not helpful for finding the delivery count.\n\nLooking further, there's a mention of Tesla's vehicle production by quarter up to Q1 2023, but production and deliveries are two different things. Tesla might produce a certain number of vehicles but deliver fewer due to various factors like logistics or quality checks.\n\nThere's a table referenced that shows Supercharger locations from 2013 to 2022, but that's not relevant to vehicle deliveries. The document also talks about the market share in the U.S. and brand value, which doesn't directly relate to the number of vehicles delivered.\n\nI see some specific dates and mentions, like January 2, 2022, where Tesla reports deliveries, but that's for 2022, not 2021. Another date, June 7, 2023, mentions deliveries in 2023, which is after the year we're interested in.\n\nThere's a mention of Tesla's deliveries in 2022 being 1.31 million, which grew by 40% from the previous year. If I can find the 2021 delivery number, I can see if that growth makes sense. However, the documents don't provide the 2021 figure directly.\n\nI also check if there's any quarterly data that might add up to the annual number, but the documents don't provide a breakdown by quarter for 2021. They do mention that from July 2018 to July 2021, Tesla added a certain number of Superchargers, but that's not about deliveries.\n\nSince none of the provided documents explicitly state the number of vehicles Tesla delivered in 2021, I can't find the answer here. I might need to look up external sources or Tesla's official reports for 2021 to get the exact figure, but based solely on the given documents, the information isn't available.\n</think>\n\nI cannot answer the question because of insufficient information in the documents.", "docs": ["Annual sales of Tesla cars in China boast the following climbing trajectory: At the beginning of 2022, there were 3,724 Tesla Supercharger stations around the world.

This is a factual question that requires up-to-date or specific information about business acquisitions. \n\nNow, looking at the answer, it's a straightforward statement saying the person can't answer the question. That could be because the information isn't available, the document retrieved doesn't contain the necessary details, or perhaps the answer isn't known at all. \n\nIn the demonstrations provided earlier, similar situations occurred where the answer either addressed the question or didn't. For instance, when the answer was \"Serena Williams\" for the Australian Open champion, it was a clear yes. But when the answer stated that the location of ACL2023 wasn't confirmed or that the GDP of China couldn't be answered, it was a no because the document didn't provide the required information.\n\nApplying that logic here, since the answer explicitly says it can't answer the question, it means the retrieved document doesn't contain the information needed to address the acquisition of ShowBiz Cinemas. Therefore, the question isn't addressed by the documents.\n\nI should also consider why the answer can't provide the information. It might be that the document doesn't mention ShowBiz Cinemas at all, or it does but without details on the acquisition.

It notes that Super Bowl LV was in 2021 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. Then, it mentions that Super Bowl LVII is set for 2023 in Arizona. Wait, but the question is about 2022, which would be Super Bowl LVI. \n\nLooking further, the document says that the 2021 Los Angeles Rams won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium.

Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.  To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.", "At Super Bowl LV, it was Tom Brady stealing the show yet again, but for the first time in his career, not while wearing a New England Patriots jersey.  Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla.

Let me check the documents provided. \n\nLooking at the first document, it's about the 80th Golden Globes. It mentions that \"The Fabelmans\" won Best Drama Film honors. But the question is about the 79th, so that's the previous year. \n\nThe second document has a date of Dec 13, 2021, and mentions the 79th annual Golden Globes were held on Jan 9, 2022. It lists the nominees for Best Motion Picture - Drama as \"The Fabelmans,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" \"Elvis,\" \"Tár,\" and \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" Wait, but that can't be right because \"The Fabelmans\" was released in 2022, so it wouldn't have been nominated for the 79th Globes. \n\nWait, I'm confused. The first document talks about the 80th Globes, which would be 2023, and the second document is about the 79th, which was in 2022. But the nominees listed in the second document for Best Drama include \"The Fabelmans,\" which actually came out in 2022, so that would make sense for the 80th Globes, not the 79th. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a mistake in the documents. The second document might be mislabeled. The 79th Globes in 2022 wouldn't have \"The Fabelmans\" as a nominee because it wasn't released yet. So perhaps the correct winner for the 79th Globes in 2022 was a different film. \n\nI recall that \"The Power of the Dog\" won the Golden Globe for Best Drama in 2022. Let me check that. Yes, \"The Power of the Dog\" directed by Jane Campion won the Best Motion Picture - Drama at the 79th Golden Globes. \n\nSo the documents provided have some inconsistencies. The second document incorrectly lists nominees for the 79th Globes, including films from 2022.

Let me look through the provided documents to find any relevant information.\n\nFirst, I see that the document mentions the 2021 Super Bowl had a cost of $5.5 million for a 30-second spot, which was a slight drop from the pre-pandemic high of $5.6 million. Then, it talks about YouTube's AdBlitz for the 16th year, noting that 72% of fans rewatch some commercials. It also mentions that AdBlitz already has 2022 teaser ads, suggesting that the 2022 event is being promoted, but it doesn't give the exact price for that year.\n\nLooking further down, there's a section about the most expensive Super Bowl ad being in 2020, with Amazon and Google each spending $16.8 million for 90-second spots. That's much higher, but it's for a longer ad and from a different year.\n\nThe document then discusses the 2023 Super Bowl, stating that the longest commercial is yet to be determined, but it doesn't provide the 2022 prices. It mentions that in 2021, the regular season viewership was up, and the league's value is high because of the ad revenue.\n\nThere's a part where it says that in 2020, the highest recorded price for a Super Bowl commercial was $5.6 million, which was around the same average for the 2020 Super Bowl. It also notes that some companies pay extra for longer ads, like 45 or 60 seconds.\n\nAnother section mentions that in 2019, Fox charged $5.6 million for a Super Bowl ad. Then, it says that most sold between $6 million and $7 million, according to Variety, but that's in the context of 2023, I think, because it's talking about the first Super Bowl costing $37,500 and then the prices increasing over the years.\n\nWait, let me check again. The document says, \"Most sold between $6 million and $7 million, according to Variety. By comparison, in 2019, Fox reportedly charged $5.6 million for a Super Bowl ad.\" So, the $6-7 million range is for 2023, and 2019 was $5.6 million.\n\nSo, putting this together, the 2021 Super Bowl was $5.5 million, which was a slight drop due to the pandemic. The 2020 Super Bowl had $5.6 million spots. The document doesn't explicitly mention the 2022 prices, but it does say that in 2023, the prices went up to between $6 and $7 million.\n\nSince 2022 isn't directly mentioned, I have to infer. Typically, Super Bowl ad prices trend upwards each year, barring any economic downturns like the pandemic. Since 2021 was $5.5 million, and 2023 is $6-7 million, it's reasonable to assume that 2022 would be between those numbers. Maybe around $5.8 million to $6.5 million? But without explicit data, I can't be certain.\n\nWait, the document also mentions that YouTube had 2022 teaser ads, implying that the 2022 event was covered, but it doesn't state the exact price. It might not have the specific 2022 figure.\n\nSo, based on the documents provided, there's no explicit mention of the 2022 Super Bowl's 30-second spot price. Therefore, I can't provide an accurate answer because the information isn't present in the documents.\n</think>\n\nI cannot answer the question because of insufficient information in the documents.", "docs": ["The pandemic had a minor but noticeable effect as the cost of a 30-second spot in the 2021 Super Bowl was $5.5 million – down $100,000 from the pre-pandemic high of $5.6 million.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE YouTube announced that it will bring back the AdBlitz for the 16th year running, noting that 72% of fans rewatch at least some football commercials.

The league’s viewership for the 2021 regular season was up roughly 10% overall from last year, bringing in an average of 17.1 million viewers per game.            That is the highest regular season average since 2015, according to the league, and comes at a time when ratings for other big live events — such as awards shows — are experiencing record lows.           Calkins explained that for networks like NBC there’s “two big benefits” to being in business with the NFL and broadcasting the Super Bowl. The first is the surplus of ad revenue and the other is “NBC will use this opportunity to support the rest of their lineup” via promos before, during and after the game.     Welcome to the crypto Super Bowl         “For NBC, the Super Bowl is an event that they can use to jump start the rest of their lineup as they go into the spring and the rest of the year,” he said.", "CBS hosted Super Bowl 55, and the highest recorded price for a Super Bowl commercial was $5.6 million. This was around the same average for the 2020 Super Bowl, too. On top of paying for a cable television ad spot, CBS required companies to pay an additional $300,000 if they wanted their ad to be included on CBS' live stream. Super Bowl commercials typically last 30 seconds, just like regular commercials. Some companies push the time down to 15 seconds, or even pay extra money to run a 45- or 60-second ad. Each year, there are around 80 to 90 Super Bowl commercials ran during the broadcast. Lovinger from NBC said that this year would be around the same.

Google's acquisition of Raxium is more about expanding Google's more robust, business-centric AR strategy. Moreover, the acquisition is a wake-up call to its competitors.   MicroLED is a promising emerging technology for displays that are already seen as the best choice for next-generation AR displays due to its greater energy efficiency, availability for bright environments, and vibrant colors.   In the display field, OLED was once seen as the most ideal choice for AR applications due to its high pixel density and the advantage of no backlight. However, the limitation of OLEDs in AR applications is that most AR headset devices are used in sunlit environments. As a result, the low brightness environment required by OLEDs can be an issue.   Guillaume Chansin, head of display research at DSCC, a display research organization, said, \"MicroLEDs can be used in brighter environments than OLEDs, which is especially important for AR smart glasses that need to be used outdoors.", "3][4] In May 2019, Google VR/AR head Clay Bavor told CNET that the company was heavily invested in R&D regarding AR devices,[5] while a February 2020 report from The Information revealed that Google had no plans to develop a new pair of augmented reality (AR) smartglasses as of mid-2019, in part due to the highly publicized failure of Glass.[6] In June 2020, Google acquired North, a manufacturer of smartglasses, to assist in its hardware division's vision of ambient computing.[7]  In August 2021, following the announcement that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro smartphones would feature the custom-developed Tensor system-on-chip (SoC), Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh told Business Insider that he believed that Tensor had long-term potential for AR-powered smartglasses,[8] and was echoed by CEO Sundar Pichai in October.[9] In November, a \"Google Labs\" division led by Bavor was created to oversee Google's AR and virtual reality (VR) ventures, unrelated to the defunct service of the same name,[10] while development on an AR operating system began the next month for an unknown \"innovative AR device\", an effort spearheaded by Mark Lucovsky.[11] Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that Google was working on a \"new iteration\" of smartglasses as a result of its acquisition of North.", "\"That device is in early planning and may still change significantly,\" the source tells Business Insider. With the demise of Hololens 3, Microsoft has moved away from its own Windows-based mixed reality operating system, which formed the basis of Hololens 1 and 2, the source says. Project Bondi, developed with Samsung, will likely rely on Android, while it is still unclear which operating system will be used for the more distant cloud-streaming headset. However, it will likely be necessary for HoloLens developers to rewrite some or all of their software from scratch, it said. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw would not comment on the rumors. Microsoft's big AR shift The report speaks of a deep technical realignment of Microsoft's mixed reality strategy, which is an apt description if rumors of a move away from Windows and transparent AR optics prove true. Microsoft would thus make a radical U-turn away from Hololens 1 and 2, whose development started almost ten years ago. According to the report, the first AR glasses Microsoft developed under the codename \"Fortaleza\" reportedly had a puck-shaped feed, like Magic Leap's device. That version had been abandoned in favor of an integrated solution. The first Hololens emerged from this project, called \"Baraboo\". The direct successor to Hololens 1 was scrapped because Kipman felt the improvements were too minor and did not see any direct competition.", "Augmented Reality, Google", "The shutdown of its main XR hardware project makes us all think that Google will try to do in XR what it is already doing with smartphones: become the software platform that many hardware OEMs use. And in fact, the report claims that Google is working on an Android XR platform it could license to headset OEM partners and also a “Micro XR” platform for XR glasses.  If this report is confirmed, it means that Google plans to sit on the side and watch the hardware AR race happen between other companies, with it only offering the software platform. This can be a great idea, considering the fact that Google already successfully did it for mobile phones and that in VR we had a company, Valve, which did something similar for PCVR.  The question is if the XR hardware OEMs would like to use this new Google platform, and especially if they really want to leave Google all the revenues from the sales of the applications on the Play Store, which is where the real money is. We already saw this problem happening when HTC departed from the Steam platform to build its Viveport store because hardware sales were not enough to have an ambitious business.  Let’s see: Google is still working with Qualcomm and Samsung on a mixed-reality headset.

So, the document doesn't provide a specific name for the supercomputer, only for the chip.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the document doesn't contain the name of Meta's AI supercomputer, only the name of the chip, which is MTIA. So, the correct response would be that there's insufficient information to answer the question about the supercomputer's name.\n</think>\n\nI can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.", "docs": ["Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta “To gain better levels of efficiency and performance across our important workloads, we needed a tailored solution that’s co-designed with the model, software stack and the system hardware,” Bjorlin continued. “This provides a better experience for our users across a variety of services.” Custom AI chips are increasingly the name of the game among the Big Tech players.", "At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.) These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change? The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.", "The chip performs 660 operations per cycle and thus run up to 230 gigaflops at 350 MHz, Gupta said. AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload.

Let me go through each document step by step to see if I can find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the main document. It mentions that the Super Bowl will be the first big event at SoFi Stadium, with events scheduled for 2023 like the College Football Playoff Championship and WrestleMania 39. It also talks about the Rams and Chargers starting there in 2020 but without fans due to COVID. The stadium's seating capacity is discussed, along with construction costs and some Super Bowl-related info.\n\nThen, there's a section about the Rams being favorites for Super Bowl 56. It mentions that the NFL had previously announced State Farm Stadium for the 2023 Super Bowl and Caesars Superdome for 2025, but hadn't confirmed 2024. So, this part is talking about future Super Bowls, not 2022.\n\nLooking further, the document mentions that Super Bowl LVII (which is 57) was the first on the second Sunday in February because of the 17-game schedule starting in 2021. Prior to that, from 2003 to 2020, Super Bowls were on the first Sunday. So, Super Bowl LVII would be in 2023 because the 2021 season led to the 2022 Super Bowl (LVII is 57, so 2022). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the NFL season typically runs from the fall to the winter. So, the 2021 season would culminate in Super Bowl LVI (56) in 2022, and the 2022 season would lead to Super Bowl LVII (57) in 2023. So, the document is talking about Super Bowl LVII being in 2023, which was on the second Sunday in February. That makes sense because the 17-game season pushed the Super Bowl a week later.\n\nThe document also mentions that Super Bowl LVII was the second warmest, with a kickoff temperature of 82°F. It was hosted at SoFi Stadium, which is the home of the Rams and Chargers. The Rams were the designated visiting team but used their home locker room, while the Bengals used the Chargers' locker room. The Bengals wore black jerseys, and the Rams wore alternate white jerseys.\n\nThere's also information about NBC broadcasting the Super Bowl and the Olympics, constructing an outdoor stage, and Mike Tirico hosting from different locations. But none of this directly mentions the 2022 Super Bowl date.\n\nWait, in the document, under the section about Super Bowl LVII, it says it was the first on the second Sunday in February due to the 17-game schedule adopted in 2021. So, prior to 2021, Super Bowls were on the first Sunday. Therefore, Super Bowl LVII (57) would be in 2023, and Super Bowl LVI (56) would be in 2022.\n\nLooking for Super Bowl 2022, that's Super Bowl LVI. But the document doesn't explicitly state the date of Super Bowl LVI. It only talks about LVII in 2023. So, the information about Super Bowl LVII is in 2023, but the question is about 2022.\n\nI should check if any part of the document mentions the date of Super Bowl LVI. Let me scan again. The main document starts by talking about events at SoFi Stadium in 2023, including the Super Bowl. It mentions that the Rams are favorites for Super Bowl 56, which is LVI (56). So, Super Bowl LVI would be in 2022. But the document doesn't specify the exact date of that event. It only talks about Super Bowl LVII (57) being in 2023 on the second Sunday in February.\n\nTherefore, the provided documents don't contain the exact date of Super Bowl 2022. They mention Super Bowl LVI (56) as the one where the Rams are favorites, but they don't give the date.

The correct answer, from external knowledge, is that Super Bowl LVI (56) took place on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium.

Originally the NFL and AFL, the two leagues combined into one league in 1970 and instead split into two conferences, with 3 NFL teams converting over to the AFC to equal 13 teams on each side. The term Super Bowl was created by Kansas City Chief Owner Lamar Hunt after seeing his daughter play with a toy called the Super Ball. Only supposed to be a nickname until an official name was released, the term Super Bowl has stuck with the game ever since.

That suggests she won a medal, but not necessarily the gold. Then it talks about the schedule for the next events, so that's not directly helpful.\n\nNext, there's a part about an American skater named Jackson.

Bowe focused on other distances, and Jackson ended up finishing the race with a time close to the Olympic record.

Vanessa Herzog was behind, and Golikova was the only one close to Takagi until the 14th pairing. Then, in pair 13, Golikova was second, and in pair 14, Jackson improved Takagi's time, taking the lead with one pair to go. The last pair didn't change the medal allocation, so Jackson must have stayed in first.\n\nThe document also mentions that Jackson's win was the first podium finish for the U.S. in speed skating at the 2022 Olympics and their first individual medal since 2010. So, all these details point to Jackson winning the gold medal in the 500m event.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the document.

It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought.

A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]", "In March, Russia organised a controversial referendum and annexed Crimea.

In response, the Russians attacked Ukrainian infrastructure, leaving many without power and water. The Associated Press Putin delivered a speech outlining his plan to mobilize an additional 300,000 troops in an effort to reclaim lost territory. The decision was highly controversial, with reports of men who were past the age of conscription being told to turn up for conscription. In response, by some estimates thousands of young Russian men fled the country, many with no plan to return. The Associated Press Putin signed final papers to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – following Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in Ukraine that the West dismissed as shams. In response, the U.S. and its allies slapped sanctions on more than 1,000 Russian people and companies, building on significant financial penalties already imposed on the nation since the invasion.

Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.[348]  Aerial warfare began on the first day of the invasion. By September, the Ukrainian air force was still at 80% of its prewar strength and had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.[349][350] By late December, 173 Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs were confirmed to have been shot down, whereas Russia had lost 171 aircraft.

It was the first public appearance of China's Mars exploration mission.[46]  As the mission preparation proceeded, in April 2020, the mission was formally named \"Tianwen-1\".[47]  On 23 July 2020, Tianwen-1 was launched from Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the island of Hainan atop a Long March 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle.[22]  In September 2020, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed the Tianwen-1 First Deployable Camera (TDC-1), a small satellite with two cameras that took photos of and tested a radio connection with Tianwen-1.[10] Its mission was to photograph the Tianwen-1 orbiter and the lander's heat shield.[10] Due to the time when it was deployed, it trajectory predicted to do a flyby of Mars with that happening around the orbit insertion date.  During its cruise to Mars, the spacecraft completed four trajectory correction maneuvers plus an additional maneuver to alter its heliocentric orbital inclination; it also performed self diagnostics on multiple payloads.", "On December 31, 2021, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed a second deployable camera (TDC-2) into Mars orbit which captured photographs of the Tianwen-1 in orbit to celebrate its achievement of the year[20] and a selfie stick payload was deployed to its working position on orbiter to take images of the orbiter's components and Chinese flag on 30 January 2022 to celebrate the Chinese New Year. In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical Federation.[35][36]  The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter, and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37]  China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the \"Tianwen Series\". \"Tianwen-1\" (Chinese: 天问一号)  is the program's first mission, and subsequent planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means \"questions to heaven\" or \"quest for heavenly truth\", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC), an ancient Chinese poet.", "The top candidate for the landing site is Utopia Planitia, a rock-strewn plain where the U.S. lander Viking 2 touched down in 1976. CNSA says Tianwen-1's goals include analysing and mapping the Martian surface and geology, looking for water ice and studying the climate and surface environment.

We learned from this that the Academy must be fully transparent and accountable in our actions and particularly in times of crisis.”  \t“We must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively for ourselves and for our industry.

However, the show did not use hosts from this point and continued as normal.[14] Smith's expletives were censored by audio muting during the live broadcast in many countries.[14][17][18][19]  Photo-journalist Brian Snyder, working for Reuters in the photographer pool in the projection booth, photographed Smith striking Rock.[20] This photo quickly went viral, was featured in news stories, and was adapted into Internet memes.[16] He was unaware of the photo's cultural impact until after the ceremony, as his photos were automatically sent to his editors.", "“In this time in my life, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.” Smith wept throughout his speech, which ranged from a defense of his actions to apologies to the Academy to an exaltation of Richard Williams. “I want to apologize to the Academy,” he said. “I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” At a comedy show that Wednesday, Rock seemed to imply that Smith has not reached out to him personally.

Let me look at the document provided. It starts with a date: Jun 14, 2023. That might be when the document was created or updated. The document talks about Mac computers using Apple silicon, specifically mentioning the M2 chip. It also discusses other chips like the M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra, which are used in various Mac models like Mac mini, MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio. \n\nThe document mentions macOS Ventura, noting that it was \"coming this fall,\" which suggests that the document was written before Ventura was released, so probably in the summer or early fall of 2023. It also refers to the M2 as the successor to the M1 chip, which was released in 2020. The M2 is described as a mid-grade chip compared to the M1 Max. Additionally, the document mentions that the M2 is used in the new MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro models.\n\nFrom general knowledge, I recall that Apple announced the M2 chip at their Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2022. This aligns with the information in the document, which is from June 2023, indicating that it's discussing the M2 chip a year after its release.

One of the categories is \"WINNER: Dune\" under a section that seems to be about sound or music, but that's not Best Picture. \n\nFurther down, there's a section with the category \"WINNER: Ariana DeBose, West Side Story\" which is for Best Supporting Actress. Then, I see another category that just says \"WINNER: Dune\" again, but without a category label.

So that must be the Best Picture category. Therefore, Dune won Best Picture.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes categories can be mislabeled. Let me double-check. The line says: \"WINNER: Dune Belfast No Time to Die The Power of the Dog West Side Story\".

It talks about Q1 2023 and Q4 2022, but I'm specifically interested in Q1 2022.

There's a note about vehicles delivered cumulatively being over 2.6 million, but without a specific breakdown, I can't determine the Q1 2022 figure from that.\n\nAdditionally, the document discusses production ramp-ups in Texas and Berlin, but these are recent developments and don't provide historical data for Q1 2022. It also talks about price wars with competitors and market share, but again, that's not directly related to the delivery numbers for that specific quarter.\n\nGiven all this, I realize that the document doesn't provide the exact number of vehicles delivered by Tesla in Q1 2022.
