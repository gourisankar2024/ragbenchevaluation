The main character, Samantha Griffith, is a heart surgeon dealing with both her job and her relationship with her father. The document also notes that the series adds familial drama to the medical procedural genre, which adds depth beyond the usual \"problem of the week\" structure.\n\nAnother part of the document mentions that the show features scenes like heart surgery, a character being shot, and some swearing, which are typical for medical dramas. It also highlights the family dynamics and the leadership challenges faced by the main character, which are common in both medical procedurals and family dramas.\n\nLooking at the second document, it's about road-trip movies and doesn't seem relevant to \"Good Sam,\" so I can ignore that part. The third document again refers to \"Good Sam\" as a medical procedural with a focus on diversity, mentioning the lead characters and their roles in the hospital. It also touches on the family drama aspect, discussing the father-daughter relationship and their interactions at work.\n\nThe fourth document compares \"Good Sam\" to other medical dramas like \"Grey’s Anatomy\" and \"The Good Doctor,\" placing it firmly within the medical drama category. However, it also points out the complex family dynamics, which adds another layer to the genre.\n\nPutting this all together, \"Good Sam\" is primarily a medical procedural drama but with significant elements of family drama. The show combines the typical medical cases and hospital setting with personal and familial conflicts, making it a blend of both genres. However, since the core setting is a hospital and focuses on medical cases and the professional lives of the surgeons, the primary genre is a medical procedural. The family drama serves as a secondary element that enriches the story but doesn't overshadow the medical aspects.\n\nTherefore, the genre of \"Good Sam\" is best described as a medical procedural drama with family drama elements.

Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms.

Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. — He’s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona. These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.", "A hugely successful high school quarterback, he threw for over 5,300 yards and 59 touchdowns at North Florida Christian High School before spending the early part of his college career at FSU. However, it was at West Virginia where his playing career took off, leading the Big 12 in completion percentage in 2014 while becoming a semifinalist for the Davey O’Brien Award. A new addition to the Marshall coaching staff for the 2023 college football season, Jason Semore becomes the Thundering Herd’s defensive coordinator. He arrives in Huntington having spent the last season with Georgia Tech, the latest stop on a varied and successful coaching career that has seen him gain experience in multiple roles at several different levels of competition. A linebacker at Adams State from 2001-2005, Semore spent 2022 working with the Georgia Tech linebackers and was slated to become their special teams coordinator with responsibilities for nickel backs and safeties. Instead, he reprises a role he previously held at Valdosta State, Montana, and the Colorado School of Mines, in addition to co-DC duties at his alma mater. He has tasted success in each of those stints. Semore helped lead Colorado School of Mines to a 10-2 season, assisted Montana in achieving three consecutive winning seasons and top-ranked Big Sky defense, and his defense fueled a Valdosta State run to the DII title game in 2021.", "2006 | Round Valley (AZ) High School (Defensive Coordinator) 2007 | Colorado School of Mines (Secondary Coach) 2008 - 2009 | Adams State (Co-Defensive Coordinator/Secondary Coach/Special Teams Coordinator) 2010 - 2011 | Tulsa (Outside Linebackers Coach) 2012 - 2013 | Oklahoma State (Defensive Assistant) 2014 | Colorado School of Mines (Defensive Coordinator) 2015 | Montana (Secondary Coach/Special Teams Coordinator) 2016 - 2017 | Montana (Defensive Coordinator) 2018 | Temple (Senior Defensive Advisor) 2019 - 2020 | Georgia Tech (Defensive Analyst) 2021 | Valdosta State (Defensive Coordinator) Semore actually has more experience than I remember seeing, but this is still the highest level position he has held and is sure to bring plenty of challenge.  At Valdosta State, Semores defense ranked top 20 nationally in defensive touchdowns, pass defense, redzone defense, and fumble recoveries. The Blazers also made an appearance in the national championship game, but failed to bring home the trophy. These are two very different coaches (in terms of experience), but I believe collectively, they are replacing one coach in all but name: Andrew Thacker.

Even if Batt chooses to hire from outside, a great run as the interim could vault Key into contention for other head coaching jobs. Key also wants to make sure his players don’t believe winning is easy after doing it twice in a row. Though he doesn’t mind letting them enjoy the new vibe on campus. “It’s been a while since we had this kind of momentum in the program,” tight end Dylan Leonard told reporters Monday. “It’s our first time with back-to-back wins. It’s great for us as players, but it’s also cool to see the fan base. You hear different conversations in the classroom. There’s a little more hype. It’s really cool walking around campus seeing people be excited about us.” Advertisement Semore worked as an analyst at Georgia Tech in 2019 and 2020 before going to Valdosta State last season to be the defensive coordinator. At the Division II powerhouse, Semore saw a team with a different attitude. The Blazers walk onto the field every week expecting to win.

The price means Microsoft will pay $95 per share for Activision. Activision's stock ended the day up more than 25%, closing at $82.31 per share on Tuesday. Microsoft's shares closed down more than 2%. This would be Microsoft's largest acquisition to date, followed by its purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 for $26.2 billion.

The news took the world by storm, and was quickly labelled one of the most influential deals in the history of gaming. Yet it’s July 2023, and the two companies are still separate due to a number of legal hurdles, lawsuits and inquiries from governments all around the world.  The merger may still go ahead, but no one truly knows if or when. The original deadline for the merger to complete was July 18th, however this has now been extended. We’ve compiled a recap to keep you abreast of the Activision Blizzard deal’s trials and tribulations. Due to the scale of the deal, regulators around the world fear that this acquisition may hurt competition and give Microsoft — which already owns Xbox — too much power in the gaming market. Fears have centred around the potential effect on market share in the console gaming market. Microsoft could, regulators argue, make Activision Blizzard’s games (including the ultra-successful Call of Duty franchise) exclusive to its consoles, thereby hurting competition with rivals Sony and Nintendo. Other concerns have been around the potential impact on market share in the growing cloud gaming market.", "January 18, 2022\t\t\t \t\t\t | Microsoft News Center  REDMOND, Wash. and Santa Monica, Calif. – Jan. 18, 2022 – With three billion people actively playing games today, and fueled by a new generation steeped in the joys of interactive entertainment, gaming is now the largest and fastest-growing form of entertainment.

Microsoft will acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony. The planned acquisition includes iconic franchises from the Activision, Blizzard and King studios like “Warcraft,” “Diablo,” “Overwatch,” “Call of Duty” and “Candy Crush,” in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming.

Activision stock hasn't reached more than $82 per share over the past year and was as low as $71 per share.", "and Google, and that Activision Blizzard lacked the computation expertise in machine learning and data analytics that would be necessary to compete with these companies. According to Kotick, this led to the idea of Microsoft, which does have those capabilities, acquiring Activision Blizzard at an attractive price point.[15] Spencer further had stated that Microsoft's intent with the acquisition is access to Activision's mobile games, which would include those by its King division such as Candy Crush Saga. He said that while there are 200 million game console users worldwide, the mobile market reaches over 3 billion people.[16] In a statement released on Activision Blizzard's investor website, the company said its industry is the \"most dynamic and exciting category of entertainment across all platforms\" and that gaming will be the forefront of the development of the emerging metaverse. Some journalists saw this acquisition, and Microsoft's March 2021 acquisition of Bethesda Softworks, as a bid to compete against Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook.[17][12][13]  The announcement had come in the wake of events related to California Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Activision Blizzard, a lawsuit raised in July 2021 accusing the company of sexual harassment, employment discrimination and retaliation on the part of Activision Blizzard.[18][19] Allegations had expanded by November 2021 to include actions that Activision Blizzard's CEO Bobby Kotick had done."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0, "evaluation": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how much Microsoft is acquiring Activision Blizzard for. I remember hearing something about this in the news a while back, but I don't recall the exact figure. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Microsoft has been in the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard, which is a big deal in the gaming industry. This acquisition is significant because it involves major franchises like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. I think the amount was in the tens of billions, but I'm not sure of the exact number.\n\nI remember that Microsoft made a bid to buy Activision Blizzard, and there were some regulatory hurdles they had to overcome. I think the deal was around $68.7 billion, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me try to piece this together.\n\nI recall that the initial offer was made in early 2022. The exact figure was a bit over $68 billion, which is a massive amount. I think it was $68.7 billion, but I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. I should probably verify this information from a reliable source to confirm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing it with another acquisition. Sometimes these big numbers can get mixed up. Let me try to remember any other details. I think the deal was one of the largest in the tech industry, so the number being over $60 billion makes sense. $68.7 billion sounds familiar, but I need to be sure.\n\nI also remember that there were some issues with the acquisition, like regulatory approvals in different countries. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority was involved, and there were concerns about the deal affecting competition. But that's more about the process than the price.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think Microsoft is acquiring Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. That seems to be the number I've heard before, but I'm still a bit uncertain. Maybe I should look up some recent news to confirm, but based on my memory, that's the figure I recall.\n</think>\n\nThe amount Microsoft is acquiring Activision Blizzard for is $68.7 billion. This figure is based on the initial offer made in early 2022 and is one of the largest deals in the tech industry, involving significant franchises and regulatory considerations.\n\n**Answer:** $68.7 billion."}

The device is said to accelerate AI research and help in building the metaverse, the next major computing platform. A supercomputer can perform high-level processing at a faster rate when compared to a normal computer. Supercomputers are made up of hundreds or thousands of powerful machines which use better artificial intelligence (AI) models to improve operations that process huge amounts of data in less time than normal computers.

The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta’s services today, but also in the metaverse.", "But Meta stressed that the MTIA, which it continues to refine, “greatly” increases the company’s efficiency in terms of performance per watt when running recommendation workloads — in turn allowing Meta to run “more enhanced” and “cutting-edge” (ostensibly) AI workloads. Perhaps one day, Meta will relegate the bulk of its AI workloads to banks of MTIAs. But for now, the social network’s relying on the GPUs in its research-focused supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC). First unveiled in January 2022, the RSC — assembled in partnership with Penguin Computing, Nvidia and Pure Storage — has completed its second-phase buildout. Meta says that it now contains a total of 2,000 Nvidia DGX A100 systems sporting 16,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs. So why build an in-house supercomputer? Well, for one, there’s peer pressure. Several years ago, Microsoft made a big to-do about its AI supercomputer built in partnership with OpenAI, and more recently said that it would team up with Nvidia to build a new AI supercomputer in the Azure cloud. Elsewhere, Google’s been touting its own AI-focused supercomputer, which has 26,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs — putting it ahead of Meta’s. Meta’s supercomputer for AI research.

In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel.

Barry Sharpless, PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry, first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’” says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.", "The Nobel Prize is a prestigious award that recognizes research at the forefront of human innovation. Moreover, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry celebrates the breakthroughs that advance the discipline in important ways. This year, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Carolyn R.

Their research is particularly important for the simplification and removal of waste during chemical reactions. The announcement of Nobel Prize winners is a cause for celebration, but also reflection. So, let’s explore the discoveries that the award has highlighted this year, and in the past. Carolyn R. Bertozzi, K. Barry Sharpless, and Morten Meldal are researchers in the field of click chemistry. Joining a list of only seven other women awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Carolyn Bertozzi made great leaps in applying click chemistry to study “human and animal physiology in new ways”. Her work relates more specifically to adapting click chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions without interfering with the normal functioning of cells. With this development, we can now study cells and biological processes in greater detail. Professor Meldal and Barry Sharpless, on the other hand, are the original developers of the click chemistry method. The method works by connecting molecular building blocks efficiently.

I remember that the 2022 Winter Olympics were in Beijing. The women's 500m is a sprint event, so it's a short distance and probably pretty intense. I think the race was held in February 2022, maybe around the middle of the month.\n\nI remember reading that an American skater made history. Her name might be Erin something. Erin Jackson, perhaps?

She skated a time that was just enough to take the top spot. There was also a Japanese skater who came in second, maybe someone named Takagi. I think her first name was Miho. And then the bronze was won by a Russian skater, but I'm not sure of her name. It might be Golikova or something similar.\n\nWait, I also recall that Erin Jackson's win wasn't just about the race itself. There was a story about her qualifying for the Olympics through a teammate's kindness. Brittany Bowe, if I remember correctly, gave up her spot so Erin could compete. That was a really nice gesture and added to the emotional aspect of her victory.\n\nSo putting it all together, Erin Jackson from the USA won the gold, Miho Takagi from Japan got silver, and Angelina Golikova from the ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) took bronze. This was a significant win because it was the first time an American had won the 500m since Bonnie Blair in 1994, and Erin was the first black woman to achieve this in speed skating.\n\nI think that's about it. I don't recall any other major details, but I'm pretty confident Erin Jackson was the gold medalist. I should double-check the times to make sure. I believe her time was around 37.04 seconds, which was just ahead of Takagi's 37.12 and Golikova's 37.21.

The original Fargo is often regarded as one of the Coen Brothers' best movies, and a great deal of its grimly hilarious sensibility has made its way into the series. Each of its first three seasons (though not as much the fourth) focused on a cat and mouse game that will be very familiar to those who enjoyed The Endgame, as officers of the law matched wits with formidable criminal minds that were willing and able to commit acts of great cruelty and malice.

What’s more, it also features a powerful cast, led by Gillian Anderson in one of her best roles. As compelling as Anderson is, she is matched by Jamie Dornan as the serial killer, who exudes his familiar charm and charisma.

There are many things that set Hannibal apart from almost every other series on network TV, but most notable are its stylized violence and the undeniable chemistry between Hannibal and Will Graham. Though supposedly enemies, the two have a bond that forms the emotional core of the series.

This is the first time that Apple’s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though — like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn’t exactly a surprising one.

When I review a particularly ugly Windows laptop, I’ll often refer to it as having a “laptop cart” look. If you were a student at any point after the early 2000s, you probably understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways.  With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for education and being sold only to schools, Microsoft is trying a different tack. The Surface Laptop SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company’s flagship Surface Laptop line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It’s quite light, at just 2.45 pounds.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods.

Will Smith slapped Chris Rock during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The reason for the slap seems to be a joke Rock made about Will Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.

The next day, he did issue an apology to Rock and the Academy via social media.\n\nFollowing the incident, there were consequences for Smith. He resigned from the Academy on April 1, 2022, and was later banned from attending Academy events for ten years starting from April 8, 2022. The incident received a lot of attention worldwide, overshadowing the rest of the ceremony. It also sparked discussions about Rock's past comments regarding Jada Pinkett Smith, specifically a 1997 interview where he commented on her participation in the Million Woman March.\n\nThere were also some details about the broadcast: in the U.S., the incident was muted due to censorship laws, but international broadcasts showed it uncensored, leading to the footage going viral on social media. The incident became known as \"the slap\" and was one of the most infamous moments in Oscars history, leading to various memes and parodies.\n\nAfter the ceremony, there was some back-and-forth about whether Smith was asked to leave but refused. There were disagreements among the Academy's leadership and the ceremony producer, Will Packer, about how to handle the situation, which ultimately led to no immediate action being taken against Smith during the event.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key points are: the slap, the reason (joke about Jada's alopecia), Smith's actions afterward, his apologies, the consequences he faced, and the widespread impact of the incident on media and public discourse.\n</think>\n\nAt the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, a notable incident occurred involving Will Smith and Chris Rock.
