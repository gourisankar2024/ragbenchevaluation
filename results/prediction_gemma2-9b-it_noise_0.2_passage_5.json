Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.", "Edwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter?  Research shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media. That's why we've added a new \"Diverse Representations\" section to our reviews that will be rolling out on an ongoing basis.", "The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith. Tensions increase as the duo also happen to work in the same hospital.  RELATED: 10 Medical Dramas That Are Better Than Grey's Anatomy Good Sam serves as an interesting watch for medical drama fans. So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey’s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam’s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed “dysfunctional family dramas”.  ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation. Even though Sam is still in her good-natured self, Rob is shown as a talented yet hot-headed surgeon.", "Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam, adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P.

In fact, this political ideology promise is exactly why Truth Social came to be in the first place. Following the wide banning of Donald Trump across multiple social media network sites in 2021, an alternative service that didn’t censor its users was advertised as in the works. In February of 2022, that alternative service manifested in the launch of Truth Social on iPhone.

During that time, weekly visits to truthsocial.com fell from 6 million to fewer than 2 million.[104]  Upon its launch, the British automotive solar power company Trailar complained Truth Social's app logo closely resembled its \"T\" logo.[105]  The platform has been criticized for its poor performance at launch, with waitlisting users attempting to register and extended outages.[106] A day after its launch, The Washington Post described it as \"a disaster\".[101] A week after, Newsweek reported some early adopters were beginning to lose interest in the app due to low numbers of users and poor engagement, although others were willing to persevere with the app to see if things would improve.[107]  The Truth Social platform suffered from severe and persistent problems with scalability at launch, limiting the platform's growth.[108][109]", "Donald Trump's much-anticipated social media platform, called Truth Social, has debuted on iOS.

So, here's what you need to know about Truth Social, which is already proving to be a controversial social media platform for various reasons. Former US President Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, is now available to download from Apple's App Store. It was launched on February 21st, 2022, which is President’s Day in the US. Immediately upon launching, the app reached the number one spot on the App Store's Top Charts. Truth Social came about following Trump's bans from various social media platforms---including Facebook and Twitter---in 2021. These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021. Before getting himself banned from various social media platforms, Trump built up huge followings. So once these mainstream social media platforms dumped him, Trump announced his intention to build his own platform. So, what is Trump’s social network about anyway? Here’s everything you need to know about Truth Social. Truth Social is a social media app founded by former US President Donald Trump and owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). This company was formed in February 2021 with the intention of building alternatives to mainstream media platforms.", "By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Truth Social, a social media network developed by former president Donald Trump’s new media company, is now live on the iOS App Store in the US. Reuters reports that the iOS app was available to download shortly before midnight, eastern time, prior to Presidents Day on February 21st. The service appears to be closely modeled on Twitter, which was previously Trump’s preferred social media platform. The former president was banned from the platform in early 2021 after Twitter said he was inciting violence in the wake of the storming of the US Capitol building.

That confirms a statement from a verified account tied to Truth Social chief product officer “Billy B,” who told people to mark February 21st on their calendars. “We’re currently set for release in the Apple App Store for Monday, February 21st,” he said, according to Reuters. Incidentally, the 21st marks the Presidents' Day holiday in the US. Provided the network doesn’t suffer a hiccup like the one it did last fall when a prankster claimed the “donaldjtrump” username and posted an image of defecting pig, the launch will mark Trump’s return to social media. Twitter and Facebook banned the former president following the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Before a test version of Truth Social was pulled down last fall, the website’s code showed it ran on a mostly unmodified version of open-source software Mastodon.

However, the Blaugrana have lost six of their seven Super Cup finals against Real Madrid and are still to win a title after the new four-team format was introduced.  Real Madrid and Barcelona booked their places for the first El Clasico of 2023 by beating Valencia and Real Betis in the semi-finals, respectively.  Real Madrid, who are one shy of equalling Barcelona’s record of 13 Super Cup titles, won their semi-final 4-2 in the penalty shootout after Karim Benzema’s first-half goal from the spot was cancelled out by Valencia in the second-half.  Barcelona, meanwhile, took the lead twice against Real Betis through Robert Lewandowski and Ansu Fati but had to win the match through penalties.", "SOCCER The line-up for the 2023 Spanish Super Cup is now set. Atlético Madrid’s draw with Sevilla on Sunday means Barcelona are guaranteed to finish second in LaLiga and have booked the final available spot in the Super Cup. The tournament will again be played in January in Saudi Arabia, with Barça joined in the Middle East by LaLiga champions Real Madrid, Copa del Rey winners Real Betis and Copa runners-up Valencia. According to Super Cup rules, the holders of the Copa del Rey take on the LaLiga runners-up in the semi-finals, while the league champions face the losing finalists from the Copa. Therefore, Betis will meet Barça in the last four, and Madrid will come up against Valencia. That throws up the possibility of a Clásico in the final, a clash that is yet to occur since the Super Cup’s expansion to a four-team tournament. Barça and Madrid have only met once so far in the revamped Super Cup, in this season’s semi-finals. Los Blancos beat the Blaugrana 3-2, before defeating Athletic Club in the final. This will be Valencia’s second appearance in the Super Cup ‘final four’, while Betis will be making their debut. The Spanish Super Cup is currently scheduled to be played from 9 to 15 January 2023.

Today, Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), a leader in game development and interactive entertainment content publisher. This acquisition will accelerate the growth in Microsoft’s gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud and will provide building blocks for the metaverse.

When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony.

The news took the world by storm, and was quickly labelled one of the most influential deals in the history of gaming. Yet it’s July 2023, and the two companies are still separate due to a number of legal hurdles, lawsuits and inquiries from governments all around the world.  The merger may still go ahead, but no one truly knows if or when. The original deadline for the merger to complete was July 18th, however this has now been extended. We’ve compiled a recap to keep you abreast of the Activision Blizzard deal’s trials and tribulations. Due to the scale of the deal, regulators around the world fear that this acquisition may hurt competition and give Microsoft — which already owns Xbox — too much power in the gaming market. Fears have centred around the potential effect on market share in the console gaming market. Microsoft could, regulators argue, make Activision Blizzard’s games (including the ultra-successful Call of Duty franchise) exclusive to its consoles, thereby hurting competition with rivals Sony and Nintendo. Other concerns have been around the potential impact on market share in the growing cloud gaming market.", "The FTC, after failing to obtain injunctions to block the merger, formally withdrew its challenge in July 2023, and the CMA subsequently agreed to put the case on hold to negotiate with both companies. The deal is now expected to close by October 18, 2023.

The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta’s services today, but also in the metaverse.", "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US  February 23, 2022 10:30 am | Updated 10:30 am IST   COMMents   SHARE   READ LATER   This picture shows the BullSequana XH3000, a next generation hybrid exascale-class supercomputer created by French information technology service and consulting company Atos, taken in Paris, on February 16, 2022 . | Photo Credit: AFP  The story so far: Facebook-parent Meta announced in January last week that it is building an AI supercomputer, the AI Research SuperCluster (RSC). The company said that this will be the fastest supercomputer in the world once fully built by mid-2022. The device is said to accelerate AI research and help in building the metaverse, the next major computing platform. A supercomputer can perform high-level processing at a faster rate when compared to a normal computer. Supercomputers are made up of hundreds or thousands of powerful machines which use better artificial intelligence (AI) models to improve operations that process huge amounts of data in less time than normal computers. They work together to perform complex operations that are not possible with normal computing systems, Sanjay Gupta, Vice President, and India Managing Director, NXP India, a global semiconductor company said to The Hindu. Supercomputers require high-speed and specialised chip architectures.", "But Meta stressed that the MTIA, which it continues to refine, “greatly” increases the company’s efficiency in terms of performance per watt when running recommendation workloads — in turn allowing Meta to run “more enhanced” and “cutting-edge” (ostensibly) AI workloads. Perhaps one day, Meta will relegate the bulk of its AI workloads to banks of MTIAs. But for now, the social network’s relying on the GPUs in its research-focused supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC). First unveiled in January 2022, the RSC — assembled in partnership with Penguin Computing, Nvidia and Pure Storage — has completed its second-phase buildout. Meta says that it now contains a total of 2,000 Nvidia DGX A100 systems sporting 16,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs. So why build an in-house supercomputer? Well, for one, there’s peer pressure. Several years ago, Microsoft made a big to-do about its AI supercomputer built in partnership with OpenAI, and more recently said that it would team up with Nvidia to build a new AI supercomputer in the Azure cloud. Elsewhere, Google’s been touting its own AI-focused supercomputer, which has 26,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs — putting it ahead of Meta’s. Meta’s supercomputer for AI research. Image Credits: Meta Meta’s supercomputer for AI research.", "By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest.  “Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.”  The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}
