The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS.", "Your Ticket Confirmation # is located under the header in your email that reads \"Your Ticket Reservation Details\".

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons.

Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. — He’s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona. These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.", "“My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.", "Even with a dad who coached, Semore knows his background – childhood on a reservation, Division II football – didn’t lend itself to the ready-made connections of other aspiring college coaches. But he says his experiences in Ganado, growing up among the Navajo, taught him how to feel at home in other cultures. And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either. This Saturday, when Georgia Tech faces Pittsburgh (8 p.m. ET, Georgia Tech Sports Network from Legends Sports), the coach’s son from Ganado will continue the next chapter in his career, charting a path few in college football have duplicated."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Patrick Mahomes and the elite offense of the Chiefs’ were stymied by the Bucs’ defense, recording zero touchdowns in the big game.  Meanwhile, Brady grabbed his seventh Super Bowl ring by throwing for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Rob Gronkowski six times for 67 yards and two touchdowns.  Super Bowl LVII is set to take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted in the Phoenix metropolitan area, with the last one coming in 2015 for Super Bowl XLIX.  The 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls are also set. Super Bowl LVIII will be hosted by Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play, and Super Bowl LVIX will be at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, home of the Saints.", "Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).  Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in the New York area—Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium.", "Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]", "Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.  To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.", "The 49ers reportedly requested to wear an all-white third jersey ensemble for Super Bowl LIV, which the San Francisco Chronicle noted they could do with special permission from the league; the league never granted such permission, and the 49ers instead opted for their standard uniform of white jerseys with gold pants.[76]  Fifteen different regions have hosted Super Bowls.

No word yet on when Truth Social will submit an Android app so Trump can stop complaining about Google.   More in", "In early March 2022, multiple sources reported that Truth Social usage remained low, with Trump himself not having posted to his account since his first message two weeks earlier and his account having only 140,000 followers—less than 0.2% of the 90 million followers he had on Twitter before his account was banned.[81][108] The Daily Dot reported the Truth Social iOS app had fallen from the number one slot for downloads on the Apple App Store to number 84.[110] The Daily Beast reported Trump was dissatisfied with the social network's progress.[109][68]  At the end of March 2022, TheWrap reported that weekly installations of the Truth Social app had fallen from 872,000 in its launch week to around 60,000 per week, a reduction of over 90%. Visits to truthsocial.com had also fallen, from 6 million per week to 1.9 million. According to Sensor Tower, Truth Social had been downloaded 1.2 million times by late March.[111] In early April 2022, Bloomberg News reported that shares in Truth Social's publicly traded holding company Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) had fallen 31% from the time of the app's launch in late February[112] and 64% from its all-time high.[113]  In early April 2022, Business Insider described Truth Social as \"like a conservative ghost town that had been overrun by bots\".", "Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to \"fuck\" him. According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant. Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform, which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce.  Truth Social announced a public beta of the web app just last week. According to a press release from Wednesday, the initial web app rollout was scheduled for some time over the next week or two.", "During May 2023, SimilarWeb's ranking of the Truth Social iOS app has fluctuated wildly, ranging from #18 to #153 in the Apple App Store social networking category during that period.[121]  Following Elon Musk's proposed acquisition of Twitter, many commentators observed that a Musk-run Twitter would be likely to reduce demand for Truth Social's services.[122][123] Musk said that as of late April 2022, Truth Social iOS app downloads exceeded those of Twitter and TikTok on the same platform.[124] He said Truth Social only existed because of Twitter's restrictions on free speech. Describing Truth Social as a \"terrible name\", Musk joked that it should be renamed \"Trumpet\".[125][126]  Following Musk's comments on Twitter, the Truth Social app rose in popularity, returning to the number 1 position for free iOS apps on Apple's App Store on April 30, with the Twitter app at number 2; DWAC shares also rose in value.[127][128]  DWAC's share price fell after Musk's announcement of his intention to buy Twitter.[129] Truth Social CEO Devin Nunes later stated that Musk had been encouraged by Trump to buy Twitter;[130] Musk denied this, saying \"This is false. I've had no communication, directly or indirectly, with Trump, who has publicly stated that he will be exclusively on Truth Social.", "[114] A U.S.-based reporter for the BBC attempted to sign up in early April and was placed on a waitlist with about 1.4 million requests ahead of him.[115]  On April 4, it was reported that Josh Adams and Billy Boozer, the platform's chief of technology and chief of product development respectively, had left the company.[52][17] A report in The Washington Post stated Truth Social was \"falling apart\", with problems mounting on multiple fronts.[116] A Guardian article compared Truth Social with Trump Steaks and Trump Vodka.[17]  As of late April 2022, MarketWatch reported Truth Social had around 513,000 active daily users, compared to Twitter's reported active daily userbase of 217 million.[117]  Usership figures were not available, but Trump was reported on August 19, 2022, to have 3.9 million Truth Social followers. He had had 89 million on Twitter and 34 million on Facebook before being banned from both platforms.[118]  As of early June 2022, SimilarWeb reported Truth Social's iOS app as ranking #49 in the social networking category of apps on the Apple App Store.[119] As of October 2022, the iOS app had sunk to #75 in the social networking category.[120]"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The projects include the new Zhangjiakou Winter Olympic Village in the Chongli district of Hebei province. The status of the Tokyo Olympics was once in doubt, and the one-year delay due to COVID-19 wreaked havoc on athletes' training and qualifying tournaments. In contrast, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach has urged Beijing officials to plan for the Winter Olympics to start on time. \"Keep going strong with regard to the preparations,\" Bach told organizers at an IOC meeting last month.  Beijing organizers recently promised to mount \"a splendid Beijing 2022 opening ceremony in a simple and safe manner, with COVID-19 countermeasures in mind.", "Mirroring a protocol adopted for the 2020 Summer Olympics before they were moved behind closed doors, the IOC also announced that only residents of the People's Republic of China would be permitted to attend the Games as spectators.[38][39]  On 23 December 2021, the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) announced that they had agreed to withdraw their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak[40] As part of their latest collective agreement with the NHLPA, the NHL had agreed to accommodate a break for the Olympics and player participation for the first time since 2014.[41]  On 17 January 2022, amid increasing lockdowns across China and the first detected case of the Omicron variant in Beijing, it was announced that ticket sales to the general public were cancelled, and that limited numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only. These, therefore, became the second Olympics in a row that were closed to the general public.", "The host nation China finished third with nine gold medals and also eleventh place by total medals won, marking its most successful performance in Winter Olympics history.[4]  The bidding calendar was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2012, with the application deadline set for 14 November 2013.[5] The IOC Executive Board reviewed the bids from all applicant cities on 7 July 2014 and selected three cities, Oslo (Norway), Almaty (Kazakhstan), and Beijing (China), as the final candidates.[6]  Several bid cities withdrew their bids during the process, citing the high costs or the lack of local support and funding for hosting the Games.[7] The Oslo bid, considered the clear frontrunner, was canceled in the wake of a series of revelations about the IOC's demands for luxury treatment of IOC members that strongly turned public opinion and the parliamentary majority against the bid. The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Project Bondi, developed with Samsung, will likely rely on Android, while it is still unclear which operating system will be used for the more distant cloud-streaming headset. However, it will likely be necessary for HoloLens developers to rewrite some or all of their software from scratch, it said. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw would not comment on the rumors. Microsoft's big AR shift The report speaks of a deep technical realignment of Microsoft's mixed reality strategy, which is an apt description if rumors of a move away from Windows and transparent AR optics prove true. Microsoft would thus make a radical U-turn away from Hololens 1 and 2, whose development started almost ten years ago. According to the report, the first AR glasses Microsoft developed under the codename \"Fortaleza\" reportedly had a puck-shaped feed, like Magic Leap's device. That version had been abandoned in favor of an integrated solution. The first Hololens emerged from this project, called \"Baraboo\".

This can be a great idea, considering the fact that Google already successfully did it for mobile phones and that in VR we had a company, Valve, which did something similar for PCVR.  The question is if the XR hardware OEMs would like to use this new Google platform, and especially if they really want to leave Google all the revenues from the sales of the applications on the Play Store, which is where the real money is. We already saw this problem happening when HTC departed from the Steam platform to build its Viveport store because hardware sales were not enough to have an ambitious business.  Let’s see: Google is still working with Qualcomm and Samsung on a mixed-reality headset.

These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change? The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy.", "The chip performs 660 operations per cycle and thus run up to 230 gigaflops at 350 MHz, Gupta said. AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload. The demand for data centres, AI, and ML (machine learning) among enterprises such as Government and educational entities, is witnessing exponential growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic boosting the demand for supercomputers, Mordor Intelligence said in a report.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

In studies of disease, bioorthogonal reactions are useful for studying not just the cells of patients but also those of pathogens: The proteins in bacteria can be labeled to follow their movements through the body. Researchers are also starting to develop engineered antibodies that can click onto their tumor targets to deliver cancer-killing therapeutics more precisely. “These very important accomplishments and these really fantastic discoveries from our three laureates have really made an enormous impact on chemistry and on science in general,” Ramström said. “For that, it’s really been to the greatest benefit of humankind.” Who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in recent years?

The Super Bowl is an annual American football games which determines the champion of the NFL. The game involves the winning team from the American Football Conference championship game facing the winning team from the National Football Conference championship game. Since 1967 when the merger agreement took place between the NFC and AFC, teams have been competing to receive the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the great coach of the Green Bay Packers. It was this team that won the first two Super Bowls, raising questions over whether the AFC was good enough to compete in the event. Originally the NFL and AFL, the two leagues combined into one league in 1970 and instead split into two conferences, with 3 NFL teams converting over to the AFC to equal 13 teams on each side. The term Super Bowl was created by Kansas City Chief Owner Lamar Hunt after seeing his daughter play with a toy called the Super Ball. Only supposed to be a nickname until an official name was released, the term Super Bowl has stuck with the game ever since.

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.  It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).", "Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"Endgame is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[196] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Avengers: Endgame achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[197] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War, such as Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com, who stated that Endgame is \"a more patient, focused film [than Infinity War], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[198] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of RogerEbert.com, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with Infinity War, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that Endgame is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film].", "7] The series premiered on February 21, 2022.[2] On May 12, 2022, NBC canceled the series after one season.[3]  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 33% approval rating based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10.

Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.[348]  Aerial warfare began on the first day of the invasion. By September, the Ukrainian air force was still at 80% of its prewar strength and had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.[349][350] By late December, 173 Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs were confirmed to have been shot down, whereas Russia had lost 171 aircraft. With the beginning of the invasion, dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.[80][81] Dozens of missile strikes across Ukraine also reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] Starting in mid-October, Russian forces launched massive missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, intending to knock out energy facilities throughout the country.", "Russia lost nearly all of the northeastern region of Kharkiv, infuriating Putin and demonstrating Ukraine’s ability to repel the Russian military by force. In response, the Russians attacked Ukrainian infrastructure, leaving many without power and water. The Associated Press Putin delivered a speech outlining his plan to mobilize an additional 300,000 troops in an effort to reclaim lost territory. The decision was highly controversial, with reports of men who were past the age of conscription being told to turn up for conscription. In response, by some estimates thousands of young Russian men fled the country, many with no plan to return. The Associated Press Putin signed final papers to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – following Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in Ukraine that the West dismissed as shams. In response, the U.S. and its allies slapped sanctions on more than 1,000 Russian people and companies, building on significant financial penalties already imposed on the nation since the invasion.

Russia later retaliated by launching missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, including on civilian areas.", "[41] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\".[42] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it \"never had a tradition of genuine statehood\".[43] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[44] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[45] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history[46][47][48] and these distortions have been cemented and propagated through the state policy.[49]  In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]", "In March, Russia organised a controversial referendum and annexed Crimea. This was followed by the outbreak of the war in Donbas, which began in April 2014 when armed Russia-backed separatists seized Ukrainian government buildings, proclaiming the independent Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.[31][32] Russian troops were involved in the conflict.[33][34][35] The Minsk agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 were a bid to stop the fighting, but ceasefires repeatedly failed.[36] A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, whereas Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.[37][38] In 2021, Putin refused offers from Zelenskyy to hold high-level talks, and the Russian government endorsed an article by former president Dmitry Medvedev arguing that it was pointless to deal with Ukraine while it remained a \"vassal\" of the United States.[39]  The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with much of the Russian neo-imperial movement aspiring to annex more Ukrainian land to create Novorossiya (New Russia).[40] Analyst Vladimir Socor argued that Putin's 2014 speech after the annexation was a \"manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism\".", "Jan 29, 2022 ...

This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.", "“In this time in my life, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.” Smith wept throughout his speech, which ranged from a defense of his actions to apologies to the Academy to an exaltation of Richard Williams. “I want to apologize to the Academy,” he said. “I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” At a comedy show that Wednesday, Rock seemed to imply that Smith has not reached out to him personally.

However, the show did not use hosts from this point and continued as normal.[14] Smith's expletives were censored by audio muting during the live broadcast in many countries.[14][17][18][19]  Photo-journalist Brian Snyder, working for Reuters in the photographer pool in the projection booth, photographed Smith striking Rock.[20] This photo quickly went viral, was featured in news stories, and was adapted into Internet memes.[16] He was unaware of the photo's cultural impact until after the ceremony, as his photos were automatically sent to his editors.", "Noah then pointed out how in Smith’s memoir, the actor shared that he grew up being afraid of conflict.  \t“It was a lot of things,” Smith said in response. “It was the little boy that watched his father beat up his mother, you know. All of that just bubbled up in that moment. That’s not who I want to be.”  \tWatch the interview here.  \tAcademy President Janet Yang reiterated during the 2023 Oscars Nominees Luncheon that the organization’s response to the 2022 ceremony was “inadequate” and that “we must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively” on similar issues in the future.  \t“As I’m sure you all remember we experienced an unprecedented event at the Oscars,” Yang said. “What happened on stage was wholly unacceptable and the response from the organization was inadequate. We learned from this that the Academy must be fully transparent and accountable in our actions and particularly in times of crisis.”  \t“We must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively for ourselves and for our industry.

Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges Méliès. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas.

His obsession with his research has jeopardized his marriage, his relationships with his kids, and his own professional future. When the Son sisters, founders of the colossal tech company Sensus, offer him a chance to complete his research, he seizes the opportunity. The catch? His lab will be in outer space on Parallaxis, the first-ever luxury residential space station built for billionaires. Alex and six other scientists leave Earth and their loved ones to become Pioneers, the beta tenants of Parallaxis. But Parallaxis is not the space palace they were sold. Day and night, the embittered crew builds the facility under pressure from Sensus, motivated by the promise that their families will join them. At home on Earth, much of the country is ablaze in wildfires and battered by storms. In Michigan, Alex’s teenage daughter, Mary Agnes, struggles through high school with the help of the ubiquitous Sensus phones implanted in everyone’s ears, archiving each humiliation, and wishing she could go to Parallaxis with her father—but her mother will never allow it.", "She has ditched academia for a gig at Sensus, where she heads a project known as Views. Unbeknownst to the Pioneers, Tess is watching their every move, studying them as part of Sensus’ efforts to predict human behavior. In addition to surveilling the Pioneers, Sensus founder Katherine Son employs Tess to spy on her sister and cofounder. Charismatic younger sister Rachel Son is the public face of the company, but it’s the shadowy eldest, Katherine, who pulls all the strings. As the climate crisis on Earth accelerates and billionaires clamber for Parallaxis I to open, Katherine sends Rachel to the space station with one goal—get it ready, or else. Name a hot-button social issue and it’s likely Rebecca Scherm’s A House Between Earth and the Moon touches on it. This is a Big Ideas book. In addition to climate change, space tourism, and Big Tech, plot points also hinge on deepfakes, cyberbullying, screen addiction, abortion rights, and surveillance. Toggling the perspective between Alex, Tess, Mary Agnes, and Rachel, and from Earth into space, a less-nimble author might’ve wound up with a story spread too thin, told too shallowly. But each character is fully realized, as is the expansive world in which they struggle to live.", "© 2023 Goodreads, Inc.", ") Mary Agnes worries that her schlubby dad will be changed by the posh Parallaxis I she sees in promotional videos, but her fear is misplaced. Parallaxis I is portrayed as pristine in advertisements but barely functions in reality. The Pioneers must double as amateur space-station builders as they scramble to get the place up and running. Alex thinks of it as a “freezing, comfortless warehouse.” It’s like a zero-gravity version of “luxury” skyscrapers riddled with issues like 432 Park, its exclusivity and high price tag obscuring how janky it is.

She frames it like they’re simply space enthusiasts, but there’s a financial angle. On Earth, they’re broke. In fact, several of the Pioneers are motivated by precarity. Meanwhile, even as Sensus’ guinea pigs sleep in makeshift dorms as they try to make the space station functional, the Sons are peddling Parallaxis I to investors as the one place privacy can truly be guaranteed.
